### Does protecting forage fish protect marine predators?

This is the GitHub repository for a project evaluating if and when the productivity of marine predators is linked to the abundance of their prey. It is a collaboration between Chris Free (UCSB), Olaf Jensen (Rutgers), and Ray Hilborn (UW) and is funded by the Science Center for Marine Fisheries (SCeMFiS).
