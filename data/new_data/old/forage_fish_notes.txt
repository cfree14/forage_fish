It would be helpful to have full country/location info


Stocks with years with weird decimals
North Sea JNCC Razorbill
North Sea Shetland Common guillemot
Norway Vedoy Black-legged kittiwake
Peru Chilean jack mackerel (two surveys)
Peru Chub mackerel (two surveys)

One stock is missing predator name info (#-Pauly et al 1989 p388 Table 1)

How does the diet information interact with the time series information? Or are these entirely separate? Like, why does the diet information align with years?

What is the season for?
